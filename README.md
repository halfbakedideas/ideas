# Half-baked ideas

This repository is for ideas for things that we don't have time to do. Contribute yours! All claims on these ideas are released to the public. They are yours. If you have suggestions for appeasing lawyers 

PRs are welcome -- add files and half-baked design documents. Drop an open license in with them if you can. Make issues in the issue tracker for other ideas that you don't have time to write up more fully but even a little description is good for.
